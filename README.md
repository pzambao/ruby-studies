This repository aims to store learnings and challenges made during my journey with Ruby language

## Present systems

  - Registration system
  - Bank balance
  - Cash withdrawal
  - Deposit and bank transfer 

- **string-of-strings.rb:** The challenge is to turn this string: '9-4-7-9-2-9-6-3', into this string: "'9','4','7','9','2','9','6','3'"

- **sort-without-sort-method.rb:** This challenge aims to develop a method to sort an array without using the .sort method
